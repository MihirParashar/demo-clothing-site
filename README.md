# demo-clothing-site
**UPDATE:** This site will not work on your device because the API is on localhost and the port isn't exposed. You'll get an error saying "API is not responding right now! Please check back later!" I am working on either port forwarding it or publicly hosting it on an API hosting service.

A work-in-progress mock clothing site that I'm developing with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
